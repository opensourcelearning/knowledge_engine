================

The Knowledge Engine is the engine of knowledge economy, just like the engine of the industrial era. You can use Knowledge Engine to build the ships, cars, airplanes, mowers, razors of knowledge era. Briefly, Knowledge Engine is to turn Significant Experiences into a dynamic streaming structure, e.g. knowledge. For more about Knowledge Engine, Significant Experiences, and what is knowledge, view them in the wiki.

Currently you don't see code here because we are now extracting Knowledge Engine out of the notebook project and put it here. We will finish that process soon.

For now, you can try putting down your Significant Experiences and see how that will help you. We have the notebook site(http://notebook.opensourcelearning.org/  or for a shorter url: http://3exps.org/ ) for you to put in your daily Significant Experiences. Go there and give it a try!

If you are working within a team, and want to see how Significant Experiences will help the knowledge cooperation within a team, stay tuned. Soon we will have another app for you to enter your Significant Experiences together with your team members or co-workers and work together on the Significant Experiences. For now, if you are too eager to see how Significant Experiences work within a team, you can check out the learning group feature in the notebook site mentioned above.
